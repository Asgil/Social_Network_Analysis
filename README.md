##You will be able to:

* **Crawl** data using official Twitter API
* **Extract and clean** whatever is useful data for you
* **Plot** all the possible useful metrics that you can find in the data using **R**
* **Have fun** with fuzzy data from social networks and explore their simplicity and complexity
